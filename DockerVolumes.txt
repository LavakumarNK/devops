Volume: to persitsance data from container layer even after deleting the conatiner we use volumes
There are two types of mountings:
  -> Voulume mounting 
      example:
       To mount from Mysql docker container : docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
       here in above example the data_volume is a folder in docker host at the path /var/lib/docker/volumes/data_volume
       
       
  -> Bind mounting
      docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql 
      here in above example the /data/mysql is a folder in docker host anywhere in the host.
      
      Note:
      using -v option in the above example is a old way 
      --mount is the latest way 
      docker run \ --mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql


Storage Drivers:
================
Dockers uses storage drivers to enable the layered architecture.
Some common drivers are:
AUFS
ZFS
BTRFS
Device Mapper
OverLay
OverlAy2

> Docker will choose the available storage driver automatically based on the opersating system.

++++++++++++++++++++++

To persist the storage we must create Volumes and voulmes are handled by voulme driver plugins 
Note: voulme are not handled by storage server.

The local volume plugin helps create a volume on the Docker host and store its data under the var/lib/docker volumes directory.

There are many other volume driver plug-ins:
============================================
that allow you to create a volume on third party solutions
like Azure file storage, 
Convoy, 
DigitalOcean,
Block Storage, 
Flocker, 
Google Compute Persistent Disks,
Cluster FS,
NetApp, 
REX-Ray, 
Portworx,
and VMware vSphere storage.

These are just a few of the many.

Some of these volume drivers support different storage providers.
For instance, REX-Ray storage driver can be used to provision storage on AWS EBS, S3.
