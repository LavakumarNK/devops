"ip link" is to list an modify interfaces on the host.

"ip addr" command is to see the IP addresses assigned to those interfaces.

"ip addr add" command is used to set IP addresses on the interfaces.

Now, remember, changes made using these commands are only valid till a restart.

If you want to persist these changes,

you must set them in the etc/network/interfaces file.

"ip route" or simply the route command is used to view the routing table.

And "ip route add" command is used to add entries into the routing table.

And finally, remember, the command to check if IP forwarding is enabled on a host,
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
